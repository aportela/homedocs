## System requirements

- PHP v8.4
- composer
- 'pdo_sqlite' & 'mbstring' php extensions
- enough disk space for storing documents

## Setup / Installation

The project currently consists of two parts:

**phpslim-api/** : Back-end (server API, also includes the latest compiled Quasar web interface/front-end). If you only want to install/use Homedocs, you can copy/use just this part.

**quasar-frontend/**: Front-end (contains the source code of the Quasar web interface). You wonâ€™t need this if you only want to use Homedocs (without developing or making changes).

Install the dependencies (in the **phpslim-api/** path).

```Shell
composer install
```

Execute the SQLite database creation/update script.

```Shell
php phpslim-api/tools/install.php
```

Check proper permissions: The web server process must have read and write permissions for files, and read, write, and execute permissions for directories.

```Shell
    Database file
        phpslim-api/data/homedocs3.sqlite3

    Storage paths
        phpslim-api/data/storage/*.*

    Debug files
        phpslim-api/data/logs/*.*
```

The system should work by default, but if you need to modify any configuration, the settings file is located at:

```Shell
    phpslim-api/config/settings.php
```

## Web server configuration:

The base path for the web server should be: **phpslim-api/public/**

Customize the web server settings according to the PHP Slim documentation:

https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/start/web-servers.html

## Migration from previous (2.x) version

**WARNING**: Before making any changes, make a backup of the files and database (located at **phpslim-api/data/**).

The storage data is retained/shared from previous versions (1.x & 2.x), but the database structure has changed. You will need to install a clean database and run a small SQLite script from the command line:

```Shell
php phpslim-api/tools/install.php
cd phpslim-api/data
sqlite3 ./homedocs3.sqlite3 < ../tools/migrate-from-v2.sql
```

## Migration from old (1.x) version to previous version (2.x)

**WARNING**: Before making any changes, make a backup of the files and database (located at **phpslim-api/data/**).

The storage data is retained/shared from the previous version (1.0), but the database structure has changed. You will need to run a small SQLite script from the command line (located under the **phpslim-api/data/** path, where old sqlite3 database is stored):

```Shell
cat ../tools/migrate-from-v1.sql | sqlite3 ./homedocs2.sqlite3

```

Once migrated, run the update script to apply the SQL version changes:

```Shell
php phpslim-api/tools/update.php
```

## Backup data

It's highly recommended to make periodic backups. All data (excluding source code), including the SQLite database and file storage, is stored under the **phpslim-api/data/** path.

## Add/recover user credentials from console

You can create or update an account from the command line using the PHP script:

```Shell
php phpslim-api/tools/set-credential.php --email myuser@myserver.net --password mysecret
```

If the account already exists, it will be overwritten with the provided data.

## Development

### Mock / example data

It is possible to generate mock example data for a user with specific credentials using the following command line:

```Shell
php phpslim-api/tools/generate-demo-data.php --count 512 --email johndoe@localhost --password secret
```

### Backend (php-slim)

Install the dependencies:

```Shell
cd phpslim-api
composer install
```

Start the local PHP (backend/API) server, listening on http://127.0.0.1:8081:

```Shell
composer start
```

### Frontend (quasar)

Install the dependencies:

```Shell
cd quasar-frontend
npm i
```

Start the local front-end (Quasar web app interface), listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080:

```Shell
quasar dev
```

Build the Quasar web app release (in **/phpslim-api/public**):

```Shell
quasar buid
```
